Terraform Templates to Deploy Infrastructure onto Azure
-------------------------------------------------------
Terraform version: 0.13.0
Azure RM provider: 2.23.0

PreRequisites:
-------------
 - Please see the section below pertaining to Credentials and Authentication

Code Organization:
-----------------

  ```
      two-tier-sample/
      - az_two_tier.tf: Contains the definition of the various artifacts that will be deployed on Azure.
      - fw_vars.tf: Define the various variables that will be required as inputs to the Terraform template.
      - terraform.tfvars: Defines default values for all the variables.
  ```

  Note: The fw_vars.tf has default values provided for certain variables. These can obviously be overridden by
        specifying those variables and values in the terraform.tfvars file.

Credentials and Authentication:
------------------------------

  - An Azure Service Principal, with the proper role and permissions needs to be created prior to deploying
    workloads into Azure using terraform.
    ```
        See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal-cli
    ```
  - Once the service principal has been created on Azure, create a file called "azure_provider.tf" (file name could be anything
    but should end with .tf) with the following fields (pertaining to the service principal):

    ```
      - provider "azurerm" {
            subscription_id = "<subscription_id>"
            client_id = "<client_id>"
            client_secret = "<secret used while creating the application>"
            tenant_id = "<tenant_id>"
            features {} 
        }
    ```

Usage:
------

   run terraform: ```terraform init``` ```terraform plan``` ```terraform apply```

 Support:
 --------

 This terraform template for Azure is released under an as-is, best effort, support policy. These scripts should be seen as community supported and Palo Alto Networks will contribute our expertise as and when possible. We do not provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the components of the project through our normal support options such as Palo Alto Networks support teams, or ASC (Authorized Support Centers) partners and backline support options. The underlying product used (the VM-Series firewall) by the scripts or templates are still supported, but the support is only for the product functionality and not for help in deploying or using the template or script itself. Unless explicitly tagged, all projects or work posted in our GitHub repository (at https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks) or sites other than our official Downloads page on https://support.paloaltonetworks.com are provided under the best effort policy.
